# Hugly

A game about avoiding being hugged by Care Bears. 

Written in Lua using [LÃ¶ve 2D](http://love2d.org).

Made during the 4th ["Game Dev Party" game jam](http://gamedevparty.fr/) in Lyon (France). 

## Jam version

Somehow we managed to organise ourselves with 8 people on the team!

* Nuts and bolts
	* Maxime Ailloud
	* Julien Deville
	* William Dyce
	* Alex Verbrugghe

* Pretty pictures
	* Jules Bacon
	* Stephanie Bottex
	* Gaelle Rouby
	* Caroline Vic

## Post-jam version

A great number of changes, especially feedback and polish:
* giblets and corpses
* screenshake
* score pop-ups
* highscore
* combo multipliers
* gameplay tweaks
